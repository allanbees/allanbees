### Glad to see you around here! 😄
I am a last year student of Computer Science at University of Costa Rica. I love learning new technologies, traveling, hanging out with friends and trying new foods.

As a student I've gotten experience in programming with paradigms like Object Oriented Programming using languages like Java and C++. I also have experience as a junior in web development, mostly front-end, using HTML/CSS/BootStrap and frameworks like React.js with SaaS (I'm still in the process of learning React, which I'm enjoying a lot). You can see more of my experience on my [resume](./CV.pdf).

### About me:

- 🌱👨🏽‍💻 I’m currently working at [Cargill](https://www.cargill.com/) as an IT Trainee, where I'll be learning with Office 365 developers using technologies like SharePoint, Power Apps and Power Automate providing solutions to clients in different countries. 
- 🌎👨🏻‍🎓 Goals: my main goal right now is focusing on defining my career path in which I intend to go towards Data Science/Machine Learning/Web and Apps Development. As well as working hard to move to another country (hoping it is USA or somewhere in Europe).
- 🤖 I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that bring me any new skills and knowledge.
- 💬 Ask me about anything you want to know about me.
- 📫 How to reach me: contact me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allan-barrantes-596572178/) or [Gmail](mailto:allandbc1202@gmail.com).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've had three dogs named Scooby-Doo (now I have a Siberian Husky named Max 🐺).
