### Glad to see you around here! ðŸ˜„
I am a last year student of Computer Science at University of Costa Rica. I love learning new technologies, traveling, hanging out with friends and food.

As a student I've gotten experience in programming with paradigms like Object Oriented Programming using languages like Java and C++. I also have experience as a junior in web development, mostly front-end, using HTML/CSS/BootStrap and frameworks like React.js with SaaS (I'm still in the process of learning React, which I'm enjoying a lot). You can see more of my experience on my resume
